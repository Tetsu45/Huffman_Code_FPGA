1. 
If there are bits that do't match any codewords in the look_up table,those bits will remain in the reg and FSM will ask for new bits to shift_Buff.
However,the shift_buf is loading new bits to upper positions of shift_buf.
For example, when there is 1111 in reg in this format 000001111,shift_buf load new bits(1100) in this way "0(1100)(1111)".
As you know,FSM read from MSB to LSB and meaning it is going to read 0 first and shift the buffer so that content of buffer becomes 110011110.
(fixed it)
2.
Shifting is also producing fake zeros.As we know whenever we shift something to left, the copies of Least significant bit gets pumped from right side.

101110001                011100011
